## important notes

### state overview

default state (desktop)
backing modal

default state (mobile)
mobile menu modal
backing modal

## components

### pledge blocks

used in both standard state and in modal, would be a good idea to make a component
has multiple states: defeault, no longer available, active, keep in mind mobile mode (probably some flex-direction: column change)

### nav titles

used in desktop and shrunk into a modal menu on click menu button
