## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Reacct

### What I learned

Practice with modals, practice with BEM and CSS classes/structure.
Connecting various pieces of data and having a controlling component - in this case connecting the pledge amount, number of backers, stock remaining.

### Continued development

When a modal is active, ensure all elements in the background are inactive/non-clickable.
Would like to restructure and rename CSS classes for clarity.
